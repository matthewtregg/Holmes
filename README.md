# Sherlock Holmes 

## App description
This is a full stack React app I created to add and explore UK crimes. It uses the UK police open data api and consists of four main screens in the front-end. This is served by a Koa backend that allows a user to add crimes at a location - on top of crimes already reported in the UK police api. 

SCREEN 1 LANDING PAGE

On the landing page a user can choose to navigate to a screen where one can either: 

a) Add crimes 
b) Search for reports of existing crimes
c) Obtain crimes stats at a given location
